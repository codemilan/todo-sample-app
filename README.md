# Todo List Example App

This project is intended to be a hands-on demonstration of ways that you can
integrate a Ruby on Rails application with Amazon Web Services. Starting from a
simple example web application, we will show you how it can take advantage of
various AWS offerings. We hope that this will be useful to you as you integrate
your own applications with AWS.

## The Application

The application itself is not complicated - it is a simple Todo List web site,
where you can create tasks, edit details about them, and update their status.

While some additional functionality may be added over time to make the example
more practical, the application is designed to be simple and easy to understand.


## Docker, Ansible, CircleCI
